ASSIGNMENT CONSTRAINTS (and other notes)
- You _may not_ use libraries, modules, extensions, plug-ins, or frameworks.
- You _may_ use any CSS3 element except those related to flexbox.
- You _must_ use float.
- The final design _must_ be responsive down to 900px (i.e. it does not need to go below 900px)

Ensure that you:
- [x] Use a **header** element to contain:
  - [x] A **page title** in the appropriate element
  - [x] A **navigation bar** broken into two sub-groupings
    - [x] The left grouping in the navigation bar needs:
      - [x] to be an unordered list of two or more items
      - [x] in each list item should have a styled link  (e.g. a link to an internal id, a link to a second page, and a link to an additional resources page)
      - [x] the list items should be aligned horizontally _and_ without bullets
    - [ ] The right grouping has one or two buttons (e.g. a link to a non-existent log-in, and a link to a non-existent profile page)
- [ ] Use the **main** element to contain your main content.
- [x] Use div elements to divide your content up into 5 logical groups which will be referred to as **cards**.
- [ ] Position your cards so there are 3 cards in a top row and 2 in the bottom row (e.g. 3 columns).  _Do **not** use a table to position your cards!_
- [x] Use a footer element to display your personal information (e.g. your name, a link to your github profile, links to any of your social media forms, etc.).  Ensure your personal information is centered in the footer.

- Make
  - [ ] small and frequent git commits
  - [ ] with messages following the basic AngularJS Git Commit Msg Convention style (per [Git Commit Messages](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html))
- [ ] Ensure you've set the GitHub pages to use your "master branch".
